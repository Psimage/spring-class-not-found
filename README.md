# Description

This is a minimal project that replicates an issue in Spring Cloud Loadbalancer.
When trying to invoke a Feign client for the first time from a thread that whose class loader is not Spring's
`LaunchedURLClassLoader`, the attempt to create context for feign client will result in `ClassNotFoundException`.

The issue gets reproduces only when the application starts from Spring's executable jar (uses Spring's class loader).
